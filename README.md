# Automation Entities

automation-entities is a package designed to color automated routines for
maximum debugability. The purpose is to provide the tools to wrap different
entities (web browser, REST API, terminal, etc) such that, when they're
interacted with, it leaves a log trail that describes each interaction in
enough detail that the user can go in after the fact and figure out what went
wrong - if anything.
